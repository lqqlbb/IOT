Description: Highly customisable, static-lease-focused DHCP server
 staticDHCPd is an extensively customisable, high-performance,
 RFC-spec-compliant DHCP server, well-suited to labs, LAN parties, home and
 small-office networks, and specialised networks of vast size.
 .
 It supports all major DHCP extension RFCs and features a rich, plugin-oriented
 web-interface, has a variety of modules, ranging from statistics-management
 to notification services to dynamic address-provisioning and
 network-auto-discovery.
 .
 Multiple backend databases are supported, from INI files to RDBMS SQL servers,
 with examples of how to write and integrate your own, such as a REST-JSON
 endpoint, simple enough to complete in minutes.
